## 🔍 Background

Mochi Healths team handles hundreds of patient support tickets every day. These tickets have a vibe—some feel frustrating, others are joyful, some just confusing.
We want to capture that vibe as it happens. This tool will help support agents log the mood of the ticket queue throughout the day, and visualize the emotional trend.

## We build a simple internal tool that allows a user to:
1. Log a Mood: Select a mood (dropdown with emoji button — e.g., 😊 😠 😕 🎉)
2. (Optional) Add a short note (e.g., “lots of Rx delays today”)
3. On submit: append the entry (timestamp, mood, note) to a Google Sheet
4. Visualize the Mood distribution for the selected date.

## Tools Used:
1. Language: Python
2. UI: Streamlit 
3. Storage: Google Sheets
4. Charting: Plotly
5. Deployment: Streamlit Community Cloud + Github
